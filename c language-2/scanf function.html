<h4>What is the format of scanf () function?</h4>

  <u1>
     <li> The scanf() function reads format-string from left to right. Characters outside of format specifications are expected to match the sequence of characters in stdin ; the matched characters in stdin are scanned but not stored. If a character in stdin conflicts with format-string, scanf() ends.</li>
