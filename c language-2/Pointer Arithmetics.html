    <h1>pointer</h1>
    <br>
    <P>variables are also known as address data types because they are used to store the address of another variable.
        The address is the memory location that is assigned to the variable. It doesnâ€™t store any value.

        Hence, there are only a few operations that are allowed to perform on Pointers in C language. The operations are
        slightly different from the ones that we generally use for mathematical calculations. The operations are:
        <u1>
            <li> Increment/Decrement of a Pointer
            <li> Addition of integer to a pointer
            <li>Subtraction of integer to a pointer
            <li> Subtracting two pointers of the same type
            <li>Comparison of pointers of the same type.
            <li> Increment/Decrement of a Pointer
        </u1>
        <br>

        Increment: It is a condition that also comes under addition. When a pointer is incremented, it actually
        increments by the number equal to the size of the data type for which it is a pointer.

            <p> printf("r++ = %u\n", r); //r++ = 6422284 +1 // 1 byte
            <p>r--;
            <p> printf("r-- = %u\n", r); //r-- = 6422283 -1 // restored to original value

            <p> Addition

            <p> When a pointer is added with a value, the value is first multiplied by the size of data type and then
                added to the pointer.</p>
